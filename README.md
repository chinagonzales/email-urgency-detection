> **ENHANCED MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING ENSEMBLE APPROACH WITH LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR CLASSIFICATION OF URGENCY QUERIES IN CUSTOMER SUPPORT EMAILS**

## Overview

The goal of this research is to develop an automated classification system that can detect and classify the urgency level of customer support emails. To achieve this, we combined traditional machine learning techniques with sentiment analysis and contextual enhancement to improve accuracy and responsiveness in customer service systems.

### Key Objectives

- Implement an enhanced **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)** classifier with improved contextual understanding.
- Integrate **sentiment analysis** to help detect high-urgency language.
- Develop an **ensemble model** combining MNB, sentiment features, and **Logistic Regression** using a soft voting approach.
- Evaluate the system in terms of **accuracy, precision**, and **execution time**.
- Address challenges with **class imbalance** and **informal language** in customer support emails.
